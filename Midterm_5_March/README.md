# Midterm Project: _M&Ms Memory Game!_

## Original Idea for Project

My original concept was simple: a tactile memory game that would incorporate multiple LED outputs and inputs, and provide some kind of reward if the user wins the game. I wanted to have a setup of four buttons (different colors) and a potentiometer on a box, and opposite to this four LEDs (of corresponding color) and a servo-controlled potentiometer head. The LED's flash and the potentiomenter turns in a randomized pattern. If the user mimics the pattern correctly, M&Ms come out of a hole in the side of the box. This is enabled with a servo that sweeps a small gate open and then shut. There is also a fast-slow switch and an on-off switch on top of the box.

## Getting Started

I started by making a practice run using four LEDs, four buttons and the breadboard that came with our kits. I set up the circuit and then wrote the code. The code essentially made a randomized array of numbers between 10 and 13 of a preset length, and then flashed the LEDs connected to the corresponding pins. If you clicked the right buttons, it would make all the LEDs flash, meaning you got it right. If you didn't get the input right only the red LED would flash. 

I split the code into three sections or "modes". I had a variable called mode and it was either 0, 1 or 2. Three if statements would activate certain parts of the loop function if the mode was correct. This allowed me to loop through specific parts of the code exclusively.
