### What it does:

This project is composed of a series of color coded buttons that make a buzzer emit a certain sound when they are pushed. Each button also has an LED associated with it, which lights up when it is pushed. There is also a screen that tells you which note is being played when you press the respective buttons. Two potentiometers are also included, one to control the volume of the buzzer and one for the contrast of the display.
