## Processing Self Portrait :)

### Description:

Using some nice math, the self portrait's eyes follows your mouse around the screen, and it has randomly generated hair! Should change every 60 seconds if you refresh the window. Other than that, it is meant to look like Daniel de Beer, but sadly it only slightly resembles him. Future extensions: maybe 3d?
