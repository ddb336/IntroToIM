# Processing - Computer Art Project

## Four different projects:

I got a bit carried away so I made four different projects inspired by different computer art pieces 

1) Blue Flower
- Draws some dots on the canvas that change color as they go across the screen
- Uses a sine function to make the dots have a pattern
- Draws them dynamically and refreshes

2) Wavy Lines
- Draws lines that move along two parametric curves
- The lines are between two points, one on each curve
- Changes color according to a sine cand cosine function

3) Shapes 
- Draws some seemingly random shapes within a blocky canvas 
- Meant to copy one of the first computer art projects I saw
- Changes the shapes based on where the mouse is

4) Lines
- Basically draws lines that point towards where the mouse is in a grid
- Same grid as "shapes"
